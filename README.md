# Convolutional-LSTM

The model was built to simulate the human behavior in a psychophysical task, which requires to remember the temporal sequence of stimulus location on the screen.

Our aim was to modulate the hidden size of LSTM (memory space) and the kernel size of CNN (visual action space) in the prediction performance of model.
